Quran Map is an Android application to summarizing the main goals and topics for each surah in the Holy Quran to visualize the big picture and then make it easier for understanding , memorizing and practicing.

App start with Arabic version but we need to support all languages , so if you can help please join the team (Translator , Graphic Designer , Mind Map designer, Developer ,...etc).

Contact details listed below.

Initial Idea come from Facebook official page of Quran Map ( https://www.facebook.com/QuranMap )

Project is very simple , It consists of 5 screens (Main , Map , Surah Details, Share , About ):

1.Main: The main screen where you can select surah by name to go to Surah's map . or see General map of all Surahs of Holy Quran. 

2.Map: The map of Surah where you understand it , you can zoom by one finger (zoom in-->slide your finger up, zoom out--> =slide your finger down) , 
Extract the map as jpg to your phone memory to print it to be used in Schools or Mosques or copy it to your pc. you go to details screen.

3.Surah Details: goal of Surah and Reason of Naming it.

4.Share: share Surah's map and details on facebook.

5.About: list of known Islamic references used to build the maps ,and useful links.


The app depends on other projects:
1. ActionBarSherlock https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock.
2. Better Arabic Reshaper (To support arabic language on Android phone which did not support Arabic) https://github.com/agawish/Better-Arabic-Reshaper.
3. Sony Ericsson Android one finger zoom tutorial http://developer.sonymobile.com/2010/07/07/android-one-finger-zoom-tutorial-part-4/
4. Facebook Android SDK https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk

We did not use sqllite , maps images exist in drawable and goal , reason of naming , url of surah on Quran Map facebook page are listed in strings.xml

We need to make map interactive and contains Holy Quran where you can select specific Ayaat of selected surah on map and read it.

Any suggestion we are welcome .
